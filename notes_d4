grep -q root /etc/passed 2> /dev/null  ## all errors sent to black hole
echo $?  ## allows to check if a command runs successfully - returns 0 is it ran ok.

PROCESS LIFECYCLE
fork() - create child duplicate of self
exec() - spawn completely new process that replaces parent
fork() + exec() - method for launching different processes
